## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my knowledge of responsive design and CSS Grid. One of the challenges was ensuring the layout adapted well to different screen sizes. Here's a code snippet showcasing the grid layout:

```css
.grid-layout {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 8fr 6fr;
  column-gap: 3rem;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me understand the basics of CSS Grid.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
